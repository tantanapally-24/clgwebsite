         <h2>Chairman</h2>
            <div class="row">
             <p>The difference between dreamers and innovators is that a dreamer just dreams and does nothing to realize it, while an innovator charts his own path and breathes life into his ideas. That streak of originality is the distinct quality that makes innovator a breed apart from the mere people of this world. Dr. L. Rathaiah, Chairman of Vignan group of institutions, was destined to be different, or should we say, he chose to be different. He was not content with just teaching. He spotted the chinks in the education system of the state and went about changing it to make it more effective, productive and powerful. He successfully altered the education scenario in A.P and brought about a socio-economic revolution of sorts. The education fraternity was so persuaded by the strength of this alternate model that they adopted the new system of imparting education without any reservation. The system initiated by this illustrious educationist, became instrumental in affecting a paradigm shift in the whole education scenario of the state. This novel model had the desired impact of enhancing the employability of the youth and shaping them into successful professionals capable of donning top leadership roles in their chosen field of interest.

 Today the state of A.P is an acknowledged hub for education. It has especially become famous for its technical education. Dr. Rathaiah has indeed set the benchmark in the field of higher education and been the guiding light for many others in the state. Truly, Dr. Lavu. Rathaiah , with his relentless efforts and dedication has changed the educational landscape of the state of Andhra Pradesh. </p>
