It is my pleasure to welcome you to the alumni section of our website, where you can feel right at home. In this section, you can be active and engaged members of the community, reconnect with your classmates and keep up to date about alumni events.<br>

I am tremendously proud of what you have all been accomplishing since leaving campus, and of how you - and the university - have grown in the past few years. As you continue on your paths, fulfilling your potential and acting as ambassadors for Vignan, I encourage you to think often on the mission Dr. Lavu Rathaiah set for Vignan's University and for you: to become leaders in the world, promoting peace and hope.<br>

We look forward to your continued success.<br>

Sincerely,<br>

     <h4>Alumni Reflections</h4>
     <p>"Uncut Diamonds never glitter, but processed one do so" I am happy to tell you that I am one of the processed products of vignan from the department of Applied Engineering. I got transformed from an average student to the topper of my batch during my 4 year study here, all happened because of my professors and their student centric teaching methods. They helped us to visualize each and every concept and demonstrated it to us with working models. Thank you Vignan for making me a competent engineer.</p>

     <p>My journey in Vignan is the most memorable part of my life. It taught me the beauty of life. Various Personality Development programs helped me in building up myself. All the Co-curricular and extra curricular activities strengthened my communication and organizing skills. Being an active student and coordinator of various technical and cultural events, still I graduated with 83.78% and got placed in TCS.All the faculty of CSE and Training cell are responsible for turning me in to what I am today. Thank you Vignan for all. I owe my career to you.</p>

     <h2>Webinars</h2>
     <p>A webinar is an online seminar that turns a presentation into a real-time conversation from anywhere in the world. Webinars allow large groups of participants to engage in online discussions or training events and share audio, documents or slides – even when they’re not in the same place as the meeting host or in the same room where the event or presentation is taking place.</p>
