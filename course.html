   <h2>Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning</h2>
   <div class="row">
   <p>VGNT has introduced a four-year B.Tech.CSE - Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machinelearning (ML) from the academic year2020-21. AI & ML is a well-establishedspecialization of computer scienceconcerned with methods to designcomputers or machines as intelligent.<br>
AIML provides applications that have an ability to learn through the experience without being explicitly Programd. ML enables applications to recognize patterns in the data in the same way as human brains do. It has become an integral part of our day to day lives and few of the widely used applications are Traffic Alerts, Social Media (Facebook, Twitter), Product Recommendations (Amazon, FlipKart), Virtual Personal Assistants (Siri, Google Assist), Directions in Google maps, Self-Driving Cars, Online Video Streaming (NetFlix). As per the recent reports, AI/ ML Engineer is the best job of 2019 due to the growing skill demand that attracts high salaries. AI/ ML professionals are getting an annual hike of 20-30% when compared to other skill areas. Starting such a program is a step towards fulfilling the high skill demand for AI/ ML professionals across the globe</p>
